                    <p>While preparing teaching materials and classes, K-12 educators have several needs:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="strong">Find replacement and supplemental materials align to curriculum standards.</span> <br> Teachers usually get a set of state curriculum standards, an overall teaching goals or plans from the school. They have to find according materials and carefully schedule the syllabus and each class.</li>
                        <li><span class="strong">Collaborate and curate the materials to meet their needs.</span> <br> When teachers find materials, they may need to clip parts of the materials, edit the content, annotate the edited materials, and even collaborate with others, like librarians.</li>
                        <li><span class="strong">Use the materials.</span> <br>Teachers need to share the original or edited material to individuals or a group, and allow discussion of the materials.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Currently there is no product which fully covers all these needs, so the preparing process requires a lot of effort to find, curate and use the materials manually. As one of the biggest content provider in the US, it's an opportunity for Gale, Cengage Learning to provide an ecosystem with rich content where educators can prepare all their curriculum standards aligned materials.</p>

                    <p><b>Using our primary persona, Henry, as an example,</b> to achieve the same goal - finding replacement materials, there might be several different scenarios. For one case, when Henry has a school district scope and sequence, or a unit plan, he may need to find all materials related to the topics or standards in these documents and develop the course outline. If Henry is interested in a topic, he can search the topic to find materials and see how they tied to standards and integrate the topic into teaching. Similarly, if he has a specific standard or teaching objective to meet, he needs to find the materials align to it.</p>

                    <p>Based on the scenarios and important goals we got, we found there are several possible user paths. We together designed several variations and integrated into two concepts. I'll focus on the concept I was responsible for.</p>

                    <p>The main workflow, shown in the following image, is based on our primary persona Henry who has unit plan and curriculum standard related materials on hand. For Henry to plan the class outline it's tedious to search all replacement materials for each teaching topic and check the standard alignment to ensure that he's using the correct materials. So it'll be helpful for him to upload the existing document and got all related materials at one time. And it's based on the fact that most educators will only use one standard at one time, so the system will automatically apply the active standard to the search. But this is not a common way to do filter in the education products, future user evaluations are needed. So, another workflow will be set the standard filter before every search if needed and always search by topics, which developed by another designer. </p>

                    <p>It's a little pity that I cannot follow the project from ideation to launch, but I really appreciate the opportunity to design for real-industry problems which are quite challenging but exciting. <b>Real-industry problems have many limitations</b> which I may not think about before. For example, we usually will not release sudden changes during midterm to avoid training costs for our customers, and all the copyright issue behind sharing in our products. </p>
                    <p> What's more, I realized the difficulty of <b>designing a new product</b>. We spent two months analyzing research results, creating our personae and defining the scope of product. And <b>involved people from other groups</b> in several important meetings to get everyone on the same page, decide the overall project time-line, technical feasibility, and so on. And I learned to create personae based on a rich search result with great variety and map personae taking suggestions from different perspectives.</p>

                        <li>Curriculum standards and materials alignment is a great <b>technical challenge</b> for our product, which also leads to possible design decisions to compensate the inaccuracy of algorithm. </li>
                        <li>Although Cengage has a rich database of primary resources, articles, books, and so on, we do not have enough supplemental materials, such as lesson plans, class activities, which need specialists to create for now. Maybe in we can make use of <b>user generate content</b>, and let users to assign materials to standards in the future. But how to assess that the alignment is reliable can be another question.</li>
