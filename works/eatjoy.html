                <h3>Emotional eaters might not be aware of their uncontrolled eating behavior and forget their health goals while eating. </h3>
                <!-- <p>In order to solve the problem, users should first be aware of the problem and face it. During the interview, we found some people lack of self-awareness and some tried to ignore their health goals even though they knew the behavior will affect their goal pursuing.</p>  -->
                <h4>Solution: Promoting self-monitoring to raise self-awareness.</h4>
                <p>Self-monitoring is a technique records one's own activities, thoughts and feelings. It's an effective way to tracking users' eating patterns, and raise their self-awareness like how frequently this happens, what's the amount and time they eat each time, and how their behavior change overtime and finally eliminate the monitored behavior, in this case the emotional eating behavior.</p>

                <!-- <p>According to research, it can be hard to stop eating if it starts. But it's possible to prevent it through social interventions. <b><br>"If someone call me to do something else at that time(emotional eating), like having a meeting, I'll not eat again after I come back, since my food carving has been interrupted."</b></p> -->
                <h4>Solution: Making use of social influence to alter mood.</h4>
                <p><b>Social support can facilitate the health behavior change and the management of chronic conditions.</b> In this case, social support can be both intentional or unintentional. Talking with friends and families about this situation and letting them monitor the behavior control. Or eliminating the craving for food through social interactions.</p>

                <!-- <p>People tends to choose high sodium and high calorie food while emotional eating. At that time they are more emotional than rational and will even eat a lot of food which they used to be strictly controlled on.</p> -->
                <h4>Solution: Recommend healthier food substitutes which align to emotional eaters' preference.</h4>
                <p>Studies showed craving for a specific food may indicate mineral deficiency, and there are lots of <b><a href="https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/article/fat-loss-articles/what-do-food-cravings-mean/">food swap ideas</a> which can meet eaters' needs.</b> But this <b>harm reduction</b> method is only a temporary solution for emotional eating, since it does not stops the emotional eating but only using healthier food to reduce the harmful results on health.</p>

                <p><b>Goals improve performance.</b> With a specific goal of the amount and time of eating will facilitate the fulfillment of emotional eating control.

                    <p>Uncontrolled emotional eating can have a long term impact on people. By manually setting alarm, stocking more healthier food at home, and marking the times I had emotional eating on the calendar the solution sometimes worked for me and sometimes failed. Similarly, for people who have suffered from it, the behavior can be hard to change. A long term test can better understand how user uses the APP when experiencing emotional eating, and how user's behavior change overtime.</b></p>
                    <h3>Food accessibility is a great influencer of food choice.</h3>
                    <p>The food being stored at home and those do not need extra preparation are more likely to be chose. We considered let users to rate how accessible the food is during onboarding. But this greatly increases the complexity of onboarding and user setting. After a round of user evaluation, we removed this for now. But other <b>more intelligent mechanisms should be involved in the solution to make sure the food we recommended is accessible for users</b>. For example, combing with grocery shopping experience to remind users to buy healthier food.</p>
                    <h3>Can better make use of social intervention and friend/family member monitoring.</h3>
                    <p>From user research, we found social distractions can sometimes stop the emotional eating behavior. But in the meanwhile, most emotional eaters do not want to disclose the behavior to their friends and family. So there is a possibility to <b>put more stress on social distractions. And even involve family or friends into the process of emotional eating control.</b></p>
