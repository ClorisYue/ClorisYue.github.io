    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>During the November 2016 Presidential election, 16 million people with disabilities reported voting. The turnout rate for people with visual impairment was 53.7%, which was much lower than people without disability, because they face barriers
          in voting. Specifically, they need assistance in filling out the ballot because the current system is not blind-friendly.
          <br><strong>Their voice is just as important as any other voter’s voice.</strong></p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p> After background research on current voting system in US, and field studies during the general election in Washtena County, we noticed several problems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Outside Help Required:</strong> The visually impaired and blind individuals require outside help in reading and writing while voting. </li>
          <li> <strong>Inconvenience Of Transportation:</strong> Transport to the polling site is not convenient for them.</li>
          <li> <strong>Choices Be Disclosed:</strong> Their choices may be known by the assistants and witnesses.</li>
          <li> <strong>Not Prepared Polling Sites and Staffs:</strong> Not every polling site has accessible voting machine. And staffs are not so well trained for operating new voting machines.</li>

    <h3>02. User Research</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>
          We conducted interviews on five experts from different organizations and communities for guidance, including Washtenaw County Clerk, people with disability and Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living. We found the disabled individuals valued <strong>the right to voting independently</strong>,
          and prefer to <strong>vote at home</strong> and use <strong>voice commands</strong> for non personal information, but use <strong>screen input</strong> for personal information. An <strong>UI with strong contrast and large font</strong> is needed
          especially for the visually impaired individuals.
        </p>
        <h4>Personas:</h4>
        <p>We found especially for the visually impaired individulas, doing absentee voting at home independently was a big problem. So we decided to focus on these two groups: <strong>the completely blind user and the visually impaired individuals</strong>.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>We decided three criterias which may constrain our design: </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The solution needs to follow current laws and regulations,</strong> in another word, does not require political leveraging.
            <li> <strong>Blind people should not have to buy extra devices</strong> just for elections. </li>
            <li> <strong>The solution should be as easy and secure as possible</strong> for the blind to vote independently.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>One main solution <strong>to help the user “see” the ballot with three possible ways to fill out the ballots</strong> emerged: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Using a physical template, like the signature guide. </li>
          <li>Locating and instructing the movement of user’s hands to fill out the check box by image processing and tracking algorithms in the App.</li>
          <li>Using a printer to mark out the boxes on the original paper ballot.</li>

    <h3>05. Prototyping</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>After validating our design concepts with our target users, we started to create two medium-fidelity prototypes which focused more on testing the usibility, functionality and voice commands of our App. And we wrote scripts for the voice commands.
          </p>
        <p>We decided two prototypes for <strong>A/B testing</strong>, the first one is a sample ballot with an App which can track the position of the pen with the help of camera and image processing. The App will give commands on how to move and black
          the box by hand manually to the user. The second one is an App which can let voter to vote by voice commands and print the result on the original received paper ballot. We created a script of voice commands and a simple UI for testing.</p>
        <p>After usability testing, we iterated on a high-fidelity prototype which fouced more on the accuracy of voice commands, and the UI design.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section-detail-layout container">
    <h3>06. Usability Testing</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>We conducted 2 rounds (7 in total) usability testing with the visually impaired community, including one blind, two visually impaired and three normal people.
          <p> Firstly, we tested on normal people while building our prototype to test the general process. For example, we let them close eyes to pretend they were blind and listen to our commands to move their pens to the checkboxes on paper to see wether
            they can understand our commands and black the box successfully. </p>
          <p> Then after we built our medium-fidelity prototypes, we conducted <strong>A/B testing</strong> with the totally blind and the visually impaired individuals on the two solutions mentioned. We used <strong> The Wizard of Oz</strong> method to test,
            one of our team member read the commands according to the user's actions, instead of developing interactive voice controlable prototype.</p>
          <p> The results showed that different users interpreted the commands differently, so standardizing commands become difficult. Also, we got some important feedbacks, for example, there would be write-in fields on paper ballot, so it's impossible
            for those who cannot write characters to fill out the ballot by hand independently. And due to different listening habbits and abilities, our commands should be modified a lot to match their habits. As a result, we decided using a printer
            to mark out the boxes can be a better choice.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h4>Key features:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Black and white interface.</strong> A strong contrast makes it more readable for the visually impaired individuals.
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Large buttons and simple interface.</strong> More readable for the visually impaired and easier to operate on the touch screen.
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Both voice and geasture control.</strong> User can use touch screen to input private information instead of speak it out. And now many visually impaired have gotton used to touch screen.
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Audio instructions.</strong> User can control the audio with the same operations as VoiceOver, the screenreader they are uesed to. And they can choose to skip or relisten some instructions by clicking the buttons on the top. Have a look

    <h3>09. Reflection </h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p> There are still unsloved problems in our final solution. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>It's difficult to set up the printer for the blind individuals. And different types of printers have different ways to connect with mobile devices, like bluetooth, wifi, email. And this is the biggest problem of the current solution. </li>
          <li>At this stage, we assume the voter's family member can help with filling out the return envelope for the voter, but we should take it into future consideration if we want this process to be totally independent. We are welcoming for any idea
            on this solution.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> That was a hard time when we stuck at these imperfect solutions, but we were so lucky to meet those helpful users, they helped us to reach out to related organization and people who may be willing to help. And it was them encouraged us to keep
          doing, since they thought it was a meaningful attempt to solve a problem which can be beneficial for their community. </p>
        <p> We hope more efforts can be made to solve this problem.</p>
