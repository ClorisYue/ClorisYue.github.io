            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>During the November 2016 Presidential election, 16 million people with disabilities reported voting. The turnout rate for people with visual impairment was 53.7%, which was much lower than people without disability, because they face barriers in voting. Specifically, they need assistance in filling out the ballot because the current system is not blind-friendly.
                <br><strong>Their voice is just as important as any other voter’s voice.</strong></p>

                    <li> <strong>Outside Help Required:</strong> The visual impaired and blind individuals require outside help in reading and writing while voting. </li>

                    We conducted interviews on five experts from different disability organizations and communities for guidance, including Washtenaw County Clerk, Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living and people with disability. We found people valued <strong>the right to vote independently, the disabled as well.</strong> And according to the background research and field study mentioned above, the visual impaired has special needs to fulfill the right, and preferred to <strong>vote at home</strong> due to the difficulty of transportation. <strong>Voice commands</strong> can help them with non personal information, but <strong>screen input</strong> is preferred for personal information. <strong>UI with strong contrast and large font</strong> is needed especially for some visual impaired individuals.

                <p>We found especially for the visual impaired individuals, doing absentee voting at home independently was a big problem. In the United States, visual impairments can be classified to partially sighted, low vision, legally blind and totally blind [from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment#United_States">wikipedia</a>]. During the interviews we found, compared with the totally blind, other visual impaired people can still see things in a blurred vision. For example, the interviewee tried to view the mobile screen by <b>putting the mobile phone quite close to her eyes</b> so she doesn't need to rely on the screen reader completely. Also, she's much familiar with the screen interactions than the totally blind interviewee. So we decided to separate them as two groups: <strong>the totally blind and other visual impaired individuals</strong>.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>But for this practical problem, we discussed and decided three criteria which may constrain our design: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The solution needs to follow current laws and regulations,</strong> in another word, does not require political leveraging.
                    <li> <strong>User should not have to buy extra devices</strong> just for elections. </li>
                    <li> <strong>The solution should be as easy and secure as possible</strong> for the visual impaired to vote independently.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on the three direction and criteria, one main solution <strong>to help the user “see” the ballot with three possible ways to fill out the ballots</strong> emerged: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Using a physical template, like the signature guide. But the template needs to be customized for each election which requires extra effort from the government, so we did not go further with this solution. </li>
                    <li>Locating and instructing the movement of user’s hands to fill out the check box by image processing and tracking algorithms in the App.</li>
                    <li>Using a printer to mark out the boxes on the original paper ballot.</li>

            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>After validating our design concepts with our target users, we started to create two medium-fidelity prototypes which focused more on testing the usability, functionality and voice commands of our App. And we wrote scripts for the voice commands.
                </p>
                <p>We decided two prototypes according to the two possible ways of filling out the paper ballots. The first one is a sample ballot with an App which can track the position of the pen with the help of camera and image processing. The App will give commands on how to move and black the box by hand to the user. The second one is an App which can let voters to vote by voice commands and print the result on the original received paper ballot. We created a script of voice commands and a simple UI for testing.</p>
                <p>After several usability testings which is described in detail in the next section, we iterated on a high-fidelity prototype which focused more on the accuracy of voice commands, and the UI design.</p>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p class="sub-title"></p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>We conducted 2 rounds (7 in total) usability testing with the visual impaired individuals (two blind, one low vision) and three normal people.</p>
                <p> Firstly, we tested on normal people about the general process while building our prototype. For example, we let them close eyes to pretend they were blind and listened to our commands to move their pens to the check boxes on paper to see whether they can understand our commands and black the boxes successfully. </p>
                <p> Then after we built our medium-fidelity prototypes, we conducted testing with the totally blind and other visual impaired individuals on the two solutions mentioned. We used <strong> The Wizard of Oz</strong> method to test, which one of our team member read the commands according to the user's actions, instead of developing interactive voice controllable prototype.</p>
                <p> The results showed that different users interpreted the commands of moving hands quite differently, so standardizing commands become difficult. Also, we got some important feedbacks, for example, there would be write-in fields on paper ballot, so <b>it's impossible for those who cannot write characters to fill out the ballot by hand</b> independently. And due to different listening habits and abilities, our commands should be modified a lot to match their habits. At first we wanted the voice commands to be nice and human-like, but <b>they usually caught the keywords in the sentences</b>, and a simple but clear command is more important to be "friendly". And the <b>speaking speed of their screen reader is so fast</b>, and it's even hard for the native speaker in our group to recognize. </p>
                <p> As a result, we decided that using a printer to mark out the boxes can be a better choice. A GUI with larger font and strong contrast is still needed. And modified the voice commands and incorporated the system screen reader they used so that they can set it according to their preference more easily.</p>

                <p> There are still unsolved problems in our final solution. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It's difficult to set up the printer for the blind individuals. And different types of printers have different ways to connect with mobile devices, like bluetooth, wifi, email. And this is the biggest problem of the current solution. But usually people just need to set the printer for once and the following printing will not be a great difficulty.</li>
                    <li>At this stage, we assume the voter's family member can help with filling out the return envelope for the voter, but we should take it into future consideration if we want this process to be totally independent. Using electrical signature which user signed in the App and print on the envelope is still possible as a future solution.</li>
                </ol>
                <p> It was a hard time when we stuck at these imperfect solutions, but we were so lucky to meet all these people who were so willing to help. They helped us to reach out to related organization and target users. And it was them encouraged us to keep going, since they thought it was a meaningful attempt to solve a problem which can be beneficial for their community. </p>
                <p> During the ConveyUX conference, we got several feedbacks and meaningful discussions on how to improve this solution. One possible solution for the printing process can be setting up printing point in the community where these visual impaired usually gather and have activities. These places are much convenient for them since they are familiar with these places and the they can connect and transfer the voting result to the settled standardized printer in a decided way. But we found most of the more efficient solutions need extra support, either finance or labor support. We hope more efforts can be made to solve this problem.</p>
