          Most scheduling and appointment Apps use calendars or lists to present information. And most gym appointments are focuses on training courses or tutors. In addition, interactive indoor maps are mostly applied to airports, hospitals, museums
          and some public buildings.</p>

        <p>One of the most important things in User Experience Design can be how to let the design tells the story about the user and develops the story with user. Story is the key to film making, so the method used in film making is helpful in storyboarding
          as well. I drew the storyboard with beginning, climax, and ending in the storyboard using wide shot (the setting of the story), long shot, POV (seeing everything from the person’s view), close-up (the detailed screen of the design solution).
          With personae and storyboards, I can better put myself in the users' shoes and understand their needs and tasks from their stories.</p>

    <h3>06. QOC Analysis</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>While deciding which one among those solutions came up in brainstorming is better for design, QOC(Questions, Options, Criteria) analysis was applied. <b>How to present the real-time occupancy information</b> is one of the key questions I wanted
          to figure out. There were 4 solutions, the first one is a room based table, the second is an online chat-bot which can automatically respond to users’ questions and requests. The third one is a map based view, and the last is a real-time indoor
          map. </p>
        <p> At first, I preferred the last solution personally, since I always confused about what facilities were in each room in CCRB. But after analyzed survey and interviews with 18 people, I found 16 out of 18 users can find the way with the help of
          indoor signs and staffs here. And when they get familiar with the gym they don’t need map or guidance to find their way any more. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p>I made the decision based on 4 criteria, how detail is the information provided, is it simple and direct to use, is it flexible to use, and is the information provided meet specific user needs. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p> Finally, I chose the first solution. The real-time occupancy information of each room presented in the table can provide detailed information to user directly. User can look through the table to find other available facilities easily, and with
          the help of search function user can directly search a specific room or facility.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>I got lots of helpful feedbacks during 3 user tests on paper prototype. Several big changes I made:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>On the real-time table view, I originally divided the gym with 3 tabs according to the floor. But the "1st", "2nd", and "3rd" (floor) were not clear to users. And if the user is not familiar with the gym, then he/she will not know which floor
            the room locates; if the user is familiar with the gym, the floor information has little meaning to he/she. </li>
          <li>I used a system alarm like notification method at first. But 3 of the users tested all thought this way was kind of annoying, and a normal notification in the notification bar was preferred. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After user testing on the paper prototype, I made a lo-fi prototype with Sketch. Then kept user testing and iterating. Modifications made on this stage: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Display of the list of gyms and fields on the main page. I first included the closed gym in the list, and only changed the background color of that item to gray to show the different status. But after testing, I considered why not just remove
            the closed gyms from the list and make the list dynamic. And divided the list into “indoor gyms” and “outdoor fields” with headers, which makes the list clearer to users. </li>
          <li>Display of the status of each room in the gym. The ratio way of presenting the "current occupancy/ maximum occupancy" is not clear to most of the user. So I tried to use two lines and add annotations of these two number. </li>
          <li>Changed background color of some pages to make the visual more unified. </li>

    <h3>10. Reflection</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>I found it important to start user research early. At first, I made some assumptions based on my experience and rationale, after user research some were approved but some were overturned. </p>

        <p> I didn’t mean to create a separate App, but I was thinking about embedded it into other UM Apps which are used by the UM community frequently. For example, the university of Michigan App includes various parts related to campus life, like blue-bus
          map and schedule, course schedule and more, so that user do not need to download a separate App and can schedule the transportation to the gym while scheduling the exercise in UM gyms.</p>

        <p> When comes to the feasibility, currently the staffs in the gym have to walk around every hour and count the number of exercisers in each room and update data in their system. So it's possible to get the data, but it's not quite "real-time". Considering
          that usually people will spend more than 30 minutes exercising, so the number of people in the gym will not change greatly in a few minutes and the current data is still acceptable to some extent. In addition, the future opportunity is the application
          of IoT in the gym. For example, using infrared detection at each room’s door to count the number of people go in and out automatically. Or using other detection modules on each facility so that the real-time occupancy information can be more
          accurate to each facility. </p>
