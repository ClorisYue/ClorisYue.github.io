        <p class="">It's the course project for <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses/501#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations</a>. Our client is Teaching and Learning group within general Information Technology Services
          (ITS T&L) of UM community and it provides academic technology environment to the UM community.</li>
          There are three tiers in ITS T&L team. Tickets come from phone calls and emails. Tier 1 is the front line, their only responsibility is to resolve tickets. If they cannot resolve a ticket, it will be escalated to Tier 2, or Tier 3. And higher tiers will
          resolve the ticket and provide feedback. Tier 2 works closely with Tier 1, and can also access to the email pool, so usually they can provide more direct instructions to Tier 1.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>We interviewed with two employees in each tiers (six in total) within the organization who occupy diverse work roles so that we can get a complete picture of how work in the organization is done and to give us the best chance of identifying problem areas.</p>

        <p class="notation">Fig. The whole Affinity Wall after 6 interviews</p>
        <p>After analyzing all our interviews, our findings generally fell under two categories: structural issues and training practices. </p>
        <p><strong>On the structural side</strong>, we found that:
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Employees in ITS lacked a strong grasp of the hierarchical structure of the organization.</b> Occasionally we encountered misunderstanding of who occupies which roles in the organization, what the tier structure is, and who tickets should
                be redirected to. </li>
              <li>Due in part to differences in preferred communication methods, <b>the communication between tiers suffers thus hindering efficacy of feedback.</b> </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>On the training side</b>, we found that: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                </b>The Canvas training in particular may be insufficient.</b>
              </li>
              <li> Canvas being so new, and there are <b>a few places where good practices could help improve performance on Canvas tickets. </b></li>
              <li> <b>Not every consultant makes a good use of google searching, effective KnowledgeBase searches, Canvas documentation and resources, and knows who to ask when all of those fail. </b></li>
              <li> <b>Consultants may not have the time to walk through the problem with the user on their own Canvas site</b> so they can see details the users leave out, and occasionally leading the user to solve their own issue. </li>
              <li> Many tickets for more peripheral the team's services such as Qualtrics are sometimes escalated to higher tiers immediately, <b>due to lack of training or other related reasons.</b></li>
            </ul>

    <h3>04. Suggestions</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Considering the relative bigger problem of training, we formed three solutions. In doing generalized training in these three areas, we hope to help the lower Tier consultants become more prepared to handle tickets. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Regarding the Canvas training, each employee should get general Canvas training, and as a part of that, create and manage their own Canvas page. </li>
          <li> The same applies the Qualtrics, we propose every employee receive basic Qualtrics training so they can have the same discernment toward the Qualtrics tickets. </li>
          <li> Several employees we talked to expressed that the method of walking users physically through the problem, and how helpful that is. We’d like to integrate that method into general training in order to make it more widely used within the Tiers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="notation">Fig. Suggestions on three services</p>
        <h5>Other Findings & Suggestions</h5>
        <p>And briefly, here are some findings and solutions we’ll be suggesting they implement: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Clarifying the organization structure and the terms they use. </li>
          <li> Standardization of technology they use for communication. </li>
          <li> Renewing the necessity for feedback on ticket escalation, and viewing that feedback.</li>

    <h3>05. Reflection</h3>

        </video>
        <p class="notation">Fig. Affinity wall in progress</p>
      </div>
      <p class="col-xs-12">We found that, generally, the organization works well and there were no major problem areas or severe workflow breakdowns as we thought. And some suggestions we thought about had actually already in their schedule, for example, creating an open FAQ database for users to solve their own problems before reaching out to the ITS T&L. <br>
      What impressed me most is how different personality could influence the interview efficiency and information gathering. While I interviewed with one of the staff from the management team, she was so open to talk and her answers always contained a lot of helpful information, but also sometimes she would lead us to unimportant information. When I interviewed with one from the lower tier, he seemed nervous and hesitated what he can talk about, even after we explained that we would take all his comments to be confidential. There is still a lot of interview skills to practice. </p>
