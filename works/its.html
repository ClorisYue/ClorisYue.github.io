			<div class="col-md-6">
		        <p class="">Our client is a group within general Information Technology Services of UM community and it provides academic technology environment to the UM community.<br> 
		        There are three tiers in the team. Tickets come from phone calls and emails. Tier1 is the front line, their only responsibility is to resolve tickets. If they cannot resolve a ticket, it will be escalated to Tier2, or Tier3. And higher tiers will resolve the ticket and provide feedback. Tier2 works closely with tier1, and can also access to the email pool, so usually they can provide more direct instructions to Tier1.</p>

				<h3>01. The Reported Problem</h3>
		        <p>So the problem is <b>the great volume of escalated tickets left little time for the higher tiers to do other projects because of limited time and resources.</b></p>

        		<h3>02. User Interview</h3>
        		<p>We interviewed with two employees in each tiers within the organization who occupy diverse work roles so that we can get a complete picture of how work in the organization is done and to give us the best chance of identifying problem areas.</p>

    			<h3>03. Affinity Wall</h3>
    			<p>After analyzing all our interviews, our findings generally fell under two categories: structural issues and training practices. <br>
    			<b>On the structural side</b>, we found that: <br>
    			- <b>Employees in ITS lacked a strong grasp of the hierarchical structure of the organization.</b> Occasionally we encountered misunderstanding of who occupies which roles in the organization, what the tier structure is, and who tickets should be redirected to. <br> 
    			- Due in part to differences in preferred communication methods, <b>the communication between tiers suffers thus hindering efficacy of feedback.</b> <br><br>
    			<b>On the training side</b>, we found that: <br>
    			- </b>The Canvas training in particular may be insufficient.</b> <br>
    			- Canvas being so new, and there are <b>a few places where good practices could help improve performance on Canvas tickets. </b><br>
    			- <b>Not every consultant makes a good use of google searching, effective KnowledgeBase searches, Canvas documentation and resources, and knows who to ask when all of those fail. </b><br>
    			- <b>Conslutants may not have the time to walk through the problem with the user on their own Canvas site</b> so they can see details the users leave out, and occasionally leading the user to solve their own issue. <br>
    			- Many tickets for more peripheral the team's services such as Qualtrics are sometimes escalated to higher tiers immediately, <b>due to lack of training or other related reasons.</b></p>

    			<h3>04. Suggestions</h3>
    	<div class="row">
    		<div class="col-md-6">
    			<p>Considering the relative bigger problem of training, we formed three solutions. In doing generalized training in these three areas, we hope to help the lower Tier consultants become more prepared to handle tickets. <br> 
    			- Regarding the Canvas training, each employee should get general Canvas training, and as a part of that, create and manage their own Canvas page. <br>  
    			- The same applies the Qualtrics, we propose every employee receive basic Qualtrics training so they can have the same discernment toward the Qualtrics tickets.  <br>
    			- Several employees we talked to expressed that the method of walking users physically through the problem, and how helpful that is. We’d like to integrate that method into general training in order to make it more widely used within the Tiers.</p>

    		<div class="col-md-6">
			    <img alt="Suggestions regarding to the training problem" src="../img/works/its/suggestion.png"/>
    			<h5>Other Findings & Suggestions</h5>
    			<p>And briefly, here are some findings and solutions we’ll be suggesting they implement: <br>
    			- Clarifying the organization structure and the terms they use. <br>
    			- Standardization of technology they use for communication. <br> 
    			- Renewing the necessity for feedback on ticket escalation, and viewing that feedback.</p>
